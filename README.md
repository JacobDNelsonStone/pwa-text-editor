# PWA Text Editor

This assignment we were tasked with building a PWA (Progressive Web Application). A PWA is a website that looks and behaves as if it is a mobile app. PWAs are built to take advantage of native mobile device features, without requiring the end user to visit an app store, make a purchase and download software locally. Instead, a PWA can be located with a search engine query and accessed immediately through a browser.
