# PWA Text Editor

This assignment we were tasked with building a PWA (Progressive Web Application). A PWA is a website that looks and behaves as if it is a mobile app. PWAs are built to take advantage of native mobile device features, without requiring the end user to visit an app store, make a purchase and download software locally. Instead, a PWA can be located with a search engine query and accessed immediately through a browser. This was super fun to see how to make a PWA!

## Installation/Usage 

Simply open the heroku link and when prompted, install the app as a PWA. 

## Code Sources 

Our instructor Gary Almes gave us some help on this asignment with some extra starter code, and put in some comments in the files with some helpful instructions. If you have any questions, he said to reach out to him!
